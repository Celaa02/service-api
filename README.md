# üõí Orders & Products API - Backend Serverless (Node.js + AWS)

This service manages the core API logic:

- **Products** management (create, update, delete, list).
- **Orders** management(create, get by ID, list by user, confirm).
- Centralized handling of **validations, logs, and errors**.
- Architecture based on **Clean Architecture** for better maintainability.

Deployed on **AWS Lambda** using **Serverless Framework**.
